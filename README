Usage
=====

Config :-

googlecl-username : "The google user id you wish to authenticate with. e.g mydevusername@googlemail.com"
googlecl-process-buffer : "Name of the buffer the googlecl process logs to"
googlecl-process-name : "Name of the process the gogole program uses"

(org-googlecl-blog) ; posts current org item to blogger/blogspot.
(googlecl-blog) ; more general function.

Requirements
============
emacs, org-mode.
The command line google utility found here http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/ .
NOTE : you must set up the Blog authorisation from the command line before using these functions. I dont know why you must do it from the command line and I haven't looked into it. Hey, maybe you don't. But all it takes is to run an example from the link above substituting the correct blog name and user the correct goggle account user and then confirming that you may use the googlecl took to access the Blogger API.

Known Issues
============
tag handling is iffy
possibly more interactive modes for editing title and labels
