Example Output
==============

Usage
=====

M-x customize-group <enter> org-googlecl <enter>

(org-googlecl-blog) ; posts current org item to blogger/blogspot.
(googlecl-blog) ; more general function.

The most straightforward usage is to set up a hot key to call

    (googlecl-prompt-blog)

This will detect if you are in org and if so ask you if you wish to blog the entire org
item - if you say "no" it will provide a normal text blog using (googlecl-blog).

This might be done like this:-

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c L") 'googlecl-list-blogs)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c B") 'googlecl-prompt-blog)



Requirements
============
emacs, org-mode.
The command line google utility found here http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/ .
NOTE : you must set up the Blog authorisation from the command line before using these functions. 

The easiest way to to this is to "google blogger list" from the command line. If you have not configured
google with the config file use the --blog option to specify which blog. 

google --help

for more details.

Coming Up
=========
Ability to list blogs based on title contents and then jump to asociated org item if it exists.
assign a UID to the blog and org item for instant match ups.


Known Issues
============
Am sure there must be a better way of getting only the text header not to include the tags.
