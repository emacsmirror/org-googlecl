Usage
=====

There are two variables to configure : org-googlecl-blogname and
org-googlecl-username. You might prefer to run the google tool from
the command line to grant authorities for the blogging service prior
to using these functions. This is discussed in the official google
documents.


(require 'org-googlecl)
.
.
.
(org-googlecl-blog) ; posts current org item to blogger/blogspot.

General musing
==============

org-googlecl-blog : posts the current org entry to your google
blogger/blogspot blog.  See http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/ for
details on downloading and installing the tool.  Another good reason
for postactions on creating new-entries - possibly using a inherited
tag, if googlecl-auto-blog tag is set we could call this function
directly with no user intervention.


Requirements
============
emacs, org-mode.
The command line google utility found here http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/ .

Known Issues
============
tag handling is iffy
possibly more interactive modes for editing title and labels
