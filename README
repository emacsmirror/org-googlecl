General musing:-

org-googlecl-blog : posts the current org entry to your google blogger/blogspot blog.
See http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/ for details on downloading and installing the tool.
Another good reason for postactions on creating new-entries - possibly using a inherited tag, if
googlecl-auto-blog tag is set we could call this function directly with no user intervention.


Requirements
============
emacs, org-mode and the command line google utility found here http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/ .

Known Issues
============
tag handling is iffy
possibly more interactive modes for editing title and labels
